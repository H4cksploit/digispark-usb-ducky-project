<h1>INTRODUCTION:
<h3><br>USB Rubber ducky is an HID device that looks similar to a USB Pen  drive.    It may be used to inject keystroke into a system, used to hack a system, steal victims essential and credential data can inject payload to the victim’s computers. The main important thing about USB Rubber ducky is that it cannot be detected by any Anti-Virus or Firewall as it acts as an HID device. The USB Rubber Ducky can perform keystroke injection attacks via accepting preset keystroke payloads. The device can even go as far as 1000 words per minutes when executing.</br><h3>

<h1>WHAT IS A HID DEVICE:
<h3><br>HID stands for Human Interface Devices, it includes devices like keyboard,    mouse, joystick. These devices act as an interface between the computer and human beings. That is why it cannot get detected as the computer thinks its an interface!</br><h3>
<h1>HISTORY:
<h3><br>The Rubber Ducky USB drive was first used by the U.S. and Israel  intelligence agencies to infiltrate Iranian nuclear facilities. By getting the USB drives into the hands of their nuclear scientists, they would use them inside the facilities to distribute malware on the network systems. The malware would overwrite the nuclear centrifuge systems to damage their equipment while modifying their control systems to show everything was normal. This secret project was called Stuxnet, one of the world’s first major digital weapons!<br><h3>
<h1>FEATURES
<br><h3>Speed can inject keystrokes at 1000 words/minute
Undetectable by Antivirus
Expandable memory via micro sd card
Simple Scripting  Language</br></h3>
<h1>HOW TO MAKE ONE
<br><h3>1: Development Boards – Arduinho/Raspberry PI.
<br>2: Android phone with Kali Nethunter
<br>3: From a normal Usb Drive<br></h3>
<h1>The Payloads we will be using in our project to either generate attacks or to steal victim’s critical information are as follows:-</h1>
<br>1: Download and execute BACKDOOR with Powershell script and get Connection to the victim PC.
<br>2: Steal all  installed Browsers data  Passwords/Cookies/History/Bookmarks/Downloads
<br>3: Minning Cryptocurrency in Victim pc with Cryptojacking attack<br>
